## About Me

My name is Charles, I am software engineering student at Wuhan University. I have strong passion for programming, learning new tech, and creating awesome projects using cool tech. I love building and working on applications that are close to the end user and have a significant impact on people's lives. Similarly I enjoy reading and experimenting with new tech and trying to see what possible live changing applications might come out of them. Simply put, I am a big **Nerd**ðŸ˜€.

## Get in touch

I love making friends and bore them by talking about technology all day long. Get in touch and convince me why I should use spaces instead of tabs.
